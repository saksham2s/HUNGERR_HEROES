                  <p class="card-text">A dosa is a cooked flat thin layered rice batter, originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a typical part of the Southern Indian and Sri Lankan Tamil diets, but the dish is now popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar, a stuffing of potatoes, and chutney. They can be consumed with idli podi as well</p>

                      <p class="card-text">Idli or idly (About this soundpronunciation (help·info)) (/ɪdliː/) are a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in southern India and northern Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">Uttapam is a type of dosa from South India. Unlike a typical dosa, which is crisp and crepe-like, uttapam is a thick pancake, with toppings.Uttapam batter is made of a 1:3 ratio of vigna mungo and rice; Rice can be a combination of parboiled rice and a regular variety such as basmati.[1] The lentils and rice are soaked overnight, ground and fermented until it rises. The batter is spread on a hot pan, generally circular, toppings spread on it and patted gently. Oil is dripped around it, flipped when it is golden-brown, oil dripped again, another flip to make sure the second surface is baked too. The Uttapam is then ready to be served and eaten</p>

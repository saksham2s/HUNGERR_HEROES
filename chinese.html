                  <p class="card-text">Noodles are unleavened dough which is stretched, extruded, or rolled flat and cut into one of a variety of shapes which usually include long, thin strips, or waves, helices, tubes, strings, or shells, or folded over, or cut into other shapes. 
                      Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. 
                      They are often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodles can be served with an accompanying sauce or in a soup. 
                      Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use. 
                      The material composition or geocultural origin must be specified when discussing noodles. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Baozi (Chinese: About this sound包子), or bao, is a type of filled bun[1] or bread-like (i.e. made with yeast) dumpling in various Chinese cuisines.
                    There are many variations in fillings (meat or vegetarian) and preparations (usually steamed). In its bun-like aspect it is very similar to the traditional Chinese mantou.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Hulatang</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Hulatang, also known as hot pepper soup or spicy soup, is a kind of Chinese traditional soup created in Henan Province but became popularized in the cuisine of Shaanxi Province. 
                      Chinese immigrants have introduced it to the United States, where it is known as "spicy soup". 
                      It can be divided into two different versions in Henan: Xiaoyaozhen version (from a town near Zhoukou City) and Beiwudu version. As its name — literally the characters 'pepper' + 'capsicum/chilli' + 'soup' — implies, capsicum and black pepper are put into the broth made by beef soup.
